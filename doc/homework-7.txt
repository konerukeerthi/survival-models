1. Open the file, diabetes.csv.

a. Calculate and graph a Kaplan-Meier curve comparing treated to untreated eyes, ignoring for now the correlations inherent in this data set. Does it appear as if these survival curves differ? If so, do they appear to violate the assumption of proportional hazards?

b. Calculate and interpret a Cox regression model using treat as an independent variable and id as a cluster effect.

c. Calculate and interpret a Cox regression model using treat as an independent variable and id as a frailty effect.

c. Calculate the complementary log-log plots.

c. Calculate, plot, and interpret the Schoenfeld residuals from a Cox regression model with year as the only independent variable. 

d. Fit a Cox regression model with gender as an independent variable and include year as a strata. Create estimated survival plots for each strata comparing males to females.
