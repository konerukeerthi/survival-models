# survival-models

This repository contains R and SAS code for running a variety
of survival models. See each individual file for requirements.

Before you run these programs, please go to 

ftp://ftp.wiley.com/public/sci_tech_med/survival/

and download these files. Store them in a subdirectorty, wiley,
under that data directory. I did not include the wiley subdirectory
in the git repository because (a) I didn't need to, and (b) I didn't
want to take a chance of running afoul of any copyright issues.
