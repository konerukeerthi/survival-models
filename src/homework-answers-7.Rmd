This file does not need any special libraries other than the ones listed below. Many of the data sets in this program use data from Hosmer, Lemeshow, and May. I made one minor change, however, which was to force all the variable names to lower case.

```{r load-libraries}
library(broom)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(magrittr)
library(survival)
library(tidyr)
```

```{r save-everything}
save.image("~/survival-models/bin/homework-answers-7.RData")
```
